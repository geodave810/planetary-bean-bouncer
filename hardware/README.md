### Planetary Gear System

The planetary gear system used in this project is based on the following
open-source design:

- **Planetary Gear Set** by *Emmett Lalish*  
- Source: https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:53451  
- License: As specified by the original author on Thingiverse

The original design has been modified for this project, including
changes to dimensions, tolerances, and integration with the
Planetary Bean Bouncer assembly.

All original licensing terms of the upstream design are respected.

## Bill of Materials (BOM)

A bill of materials is provided in the `BOM/` directory as an Excel
spreadsheet:

- `Planetary_Bean_Bouncer_BOM.xlsx`

The BOM reflects the author’s current build and may include specific
part selections or suppliers. Equivalent components may be substituted
based on availability.

The BOM and other documentation in this directory are licensed under
CC BY-NC 4.0 unless otherwise noted.

## Cost and sourcing notes

The estimated total cost for the author’s build is approximately **$234 USD**.
This reflects the specific parts used and prices at the time of purchase.

Many builders may already have some components on hand (such as fasteners,
electronics, or motors), which can significantly reduce the total cost.

Several parts may also be substituted or fabricated by the builder. For example:
- The wobble disc can be machined or cut from suitable material instead of
  being purchased as a finished part.
- Equivalent motors, drivers, and fasteners may be used depending on availability.

As with most DIY projects, actual cost will vary based on sourcing,
substitutions, and existing inventory.

### Fabricating Your Own Wobble Disc

Builders who prefer to machine or fabricate their own wobble disc rather than purchase one can follow detailed instructions from Sweet Maria’s:

- **Wobble Disc Fabrication Guide**  
  https://library.sweetmarias.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Wobble-Disc-Coffee-Roaster-3-red-tubes-model-build-instructions.pdf

This guide includes:
- Measurements
- Recommended materials
- Assembly considerations

Using this reference, builders can reduce part cost and customize the wobble disc to their own preferences. Always ensure proper balance and clearances when fabricating your own part.
