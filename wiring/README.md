# Wiring reference

This directory contains a simplified wiring reference for the
Planetary Bean Bouncer controller user interface.

## Included files

- `Planetary_Bean_Bouncer_UI.fzz`  
  Fritzing project file showing the breadboard layout.

- `Planetary_Bean_Bouncer_UI_bb.png`  
  PNG export of the breadboard view for easy viewing without Fritzing.

## Scope

The wiring diagram illustrates the following components:
- Arduino Uno
- LCD (I2C)
- Buttons
- Status LEDs
- Buzzer

Stepper motor and driver wiring is intentionally omitted, as there are
many valid configurations depending on the hardware used.

## Notes

Resistor values shown are typical; exact values are not critical.
